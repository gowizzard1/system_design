In this design;
- **SPA frontend**: communicates with API backend to retrieve data from postgres cluster and external data providers.
- **The Postgres cluster**: used to persist data, and the SQL script is used to initialize the database with the necessary schema and data. 
- **The binary**:  used to create fixtures for testing purposes.


All of these components will be deployed as Kubernetes resources. Here is a list of the Kubernetes resources that will be used:

- **Deployment**: One deployment for each component (frontend, backend, Postgres, etc.)
- **Service**: One service for each deployment to allow for inter-component communication
- **ConfigMap**: One ConfigMap to store the SQL script for initializing the database
- **Secret**: One Secret to store any sensitive information (e.g., credentials for accessing the S3 bucket)
- **PersistentVolumeClaim**: One PVC for the Postgres cluster to persist data
- **StatefulSet**: One StatefulSet for the Postgres cluster to ensure that each replica has a unique hostname
- **Ingress**: One Ingress to expose the frontend to the internet

Each of these resources will have a corresponding YAML manifest that can be used to create, update, or delete the resource in the Kubernetes cluster.

Below is example of the manifests for the above resource:

### ConfigMap

## Scalability and Perfomance

To make the system scalable and highly performant, you can consider the following best practices and techniques:

- **Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)**: HPA can be used to automatically adjust the number of replicas of your backend and frontend pods based on metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, or custom metrics. This ensures that the system can handle increases in traffic without being overwhelmed, while minimizing idle resources when traffic is low.

- **Use a Load Balancer**: A load balancer can be used to distribute traffic across multiple backend pods. Kubernetes provides a built-in load balancer, which can be used in conjunction with a cloud provider's load balancer or a third-party load balancer.

- **Implement Caching**: Caching can be used to reduce the load on the backend by serving frequently accessed data from memory rather than querying the database. Tools like Redis or Memcached can be used to implement caching.

- **Optimize Database Performance**: To ensure the best database performance, you can consider using a managed database service like Amazon RDS or Google Cloud SQL. You can also optimize database performance by creating indexes on frequently queried columns, optimizing queries, and using connection pooling.

- **Use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: CDNs can be used to cache and deliver static assets like images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files, reducing the load on the backend and improving the user experience.

- **Use asynchronous processing**: Use message queues and background workers to handle long-running or resource-intensive tasks like generating reports or processing large files. This can help to reduce the load on the backend and provide a more responsive user experience.

- **Optimize container resources**: Ensure that your containers are not overprovisioned with resources and you are using appropriate resource limits and requests.

- **Use appropriate logging and monitoring tools**: Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana and fluentd to monitor the performance of the system and identify bottlenecks.

By following these best practices, you can ensure that your system is scalable and highly performant, capable of handling increasing levels of traffic without compromising performance or stability.
